## Introduction

Sengi is a **Mastodon** and **Pleroma** desktop focused client. It takes inspiration from the old Tweetdeck [client](https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/muo-tweetdeck2b.png), the new Tweetdeck webapp and Mastodon UI. 

It is strongly focused on the following points:

  * Heavily oriented on multi-accounts usage 
  * Desktop based interactions (right clic, left clic, etc)
  * One column at a time display (leaves it on the side of your screen, and keep an eye on it while doing your other stuff)

It is released as a **browser webapp** and also packaged as an **cross-platform desktop application** (Mac, Windows, and Linux).
