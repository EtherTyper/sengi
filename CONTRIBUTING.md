# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Issue
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/NicolasConstant/sengi/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the bug, open a [new issue](https://github.com/NicolasConstant/sengi/issues/new).

Please pay attention to the following points while opening an issue.

### Write detailed information
Detailed information is very helpful to understand an issue.

For example:
* How to reproduce the issue, step-by-step.
* The expected behavior (or what is wrong).
* Screenshots for GUI issues.
* The operating system.
* The browser (if any) type and version.
* The Sengi version.


## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are maybe a bit early right now, since the project and code can change a lot, so it's not really adviced to open PR today. 
I will notify explicitly when I'll be more open to external contributions.
